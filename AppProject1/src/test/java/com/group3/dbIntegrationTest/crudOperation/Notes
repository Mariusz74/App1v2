Note 1:
The CRUD test cases here are not Unit tests but Integration tests. For this to be a unit test,
we need to use an in-memory database rather than disk database.

Note 2:
These test are not well written but it is faster to make it.We don't have much time.
 For example, many tests methods are not dependent to each other e.g getAll() is used in delete()
 
 Note 3:
 Each Crud operations cannot be seperated into it's own test classes or test methods because
 we would need to recreate table every time and repopulate everytime just to test each method. We don't have the time at the
 moment to figure out how to do it.  
 
 Note 4:
(see crud tests for details) 
The code below has to be done like this because tests need to run in this order
